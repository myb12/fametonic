## Assignment Overview

The primary goal of this assignment was to build a single-page application (homepage only) based on a provided Figma design, adhering to strict guidelines:

* **Technology Stack:** Next.js for the framework, Tailwind CSS for UI styling.
* **Design Adherence:** Implement the provided Figma design ([Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/design/CeIAZvl524VDP3SpRmDuT5/Fametonic-Open?node-id=1-141&t=niDmCrnhS5PUipNv-1)) as close to pixel-perfect as possible.
* **Responsiveness:** The design must be fully responsive across various screen sizes.
* **Interactivity:** Menu button, About Us, Contact, and Get Started elements are designed as clickable buttons/links, but their functional actions (e.g., navigation) are intentionally left unimplemented as per instructions.
